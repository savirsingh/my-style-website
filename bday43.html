<b><p class="rainbow" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: 16px; font-size: 20px">Happy Birthday Mama!</p></b>
<p class="rainbow" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 20px; font-size: 20px; width:50%">Thank you for everything you do for us. From waking up early so you can make breakfast to putting us 
to sleep, your whole day is full of struggles and surprises. But you persist. For us. And it doesn't go unnoticed. We all recognize the work you do for us and even if we try for our whole lives to replicate it, we will still
be indebted to you. On this day, I just wanted to say, "Thank you." I may not wake up early or water the plants without you telling me to, but I love you. I really do. Because you are the #1 mom in the multiverse. 
I am working really hard to get into a good university, possibly with a scholarship, so you can be proud to call me your son. I might not be able to, but I will keep trying, since I am your child. I promise, one day, 
I will make you very proud.<br><br>Again, thank you for everything you do for us Mama, and enjoy this special day to the fullest.<br><br>Love,<br>Timmu</p>
